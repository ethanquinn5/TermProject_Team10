## KPI Definitions

**Weather Time Series**  
Displays real-time weather conditions including temperature (°C), wind speed (m/s), and precipitation (mm) from the streaming weather pipeline. This chart provides live environmental context that may influence hotel booking and cancellation behavior.

**Cancellation Rate by Deposit Type**  
Shows the average cancellation rate grouped by deposit type (Refundable vs No Deposit). This KPI highlights how booking policies affect customer cancellation decisions.

**Cancellation Rate by Season**  
Displays the average cancellation rate by arrival season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter). This metric is used to identify seasonal patterns in hotel booking cancellations.

**Precipitation Time Series**  
Visualizes real-time precipitation levels over time from the streaming weather data. This KPI is used to monitor weather events that could impact guest travel behavior.

**Cancellations by Lead Time**  
Shows the cancellation rate grouped by lead time bins (days between booking and arrival). This KPI illustrates how cancellation likelihood changes as the time between booking and arrival increases.

**Cancellation Rate by Temperature Range**  
Displays the average cancellation rate across temperature bins based on historical weather conditions at arrival date. This metric evaluates whether certain temperature ranges are associated with higher cancellation rates.
