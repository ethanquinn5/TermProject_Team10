For this project I was charge of several different tasks. For the first part, we all worked together in order to make the necessary model, whether it be the inserting the information, learning how to cal the API, getting the necessary information in BigQuery and so on. We had a lot of issues with this part, and we had trouble making everything work in Google Cloud Platform, so it was a lot of work and a lot of hours dedicated to all of us being able to do that. I think that this was the hardest part, and the one that we learned the most out of. Once we had all been able to do that, I then took on doing the dashboard. I made half of the graphs that are there, uploaded the necessary data to Looker so that we could do the graphs, as well as making the dashboard look pretty. I was also in charge of making the presentation. I made the presentation, and all but one slide were my responsibility.For more personal tasks I was obviously also in charge of making my dive analysis, my prompt log, and uploading the things that I had done to the team repository. This project reinforced how complex real-world data analysis becomes once multiple data sources become involved. Being able to integrate hotel booking data with external weather data required careful attention to date alignment, data types, and join logic, because small mismatches could have easily distorted the results. I learned that feature engineering is often more important than raw data itself, having continuous variables like temperature, wind speed, and lead time only become interpretable after binning. At the same time, creating these bins became a challenge, like ensuring correct numeric ordering so visualizations reflected real-world progression rather than alphabetical sorting. The project also highlighted how visualization tools can mask underlying data issues, making validations steps like row counts and sanity checks essential. Debugging Looker Studio charts really taught me that errors are frequently caused by configuration choices rather than the data alone. I think that I also gained an appreciation for data access and governance, as sharing dashboard required explicit credential management to ensure that others could also see the things that I was working on. Overall, I think that the project really emphasized that meaningful insights come from careful data preparation, validation, and iteration, not just writing queries or building dashboards.
