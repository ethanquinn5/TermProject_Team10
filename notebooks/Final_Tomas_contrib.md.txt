Tomas Turner – Contributions

For this project, I was in charge of several different tasks throughout the semester. For the first part of the project, the entire team worked closely together to build the core pipeline, including ingesting the Kaggle dataset, learning how to call and work with the weather API, and getting all of the necessary information properly loaded into BigQuery. This stage involved a lot of trial and error, especially when working within Google Cloud Platform. We ran into multiple issues related to permissions, data ingestion, and pipeline configuration, which required significant debugging and coordination. This ended up being the most time-consuming and challenging part of the project, but it was also the part where we learned the most, particularly about how fragile real-world data pipelines can be and how important careful validation is at each step.

Once the pipeline and data integration were functioning correctly, I took primary responsibility for designing and building the Looker Studio dashboard. I created roughly half of the visualizations, ensured the correct data sources were connected, and configured metrics such as cancellation rates so that the charts accurately reflected the underlying data. I also focused on making the dashboard visually clear and easy to interpret, organizing the layout and formatting so that key insights stood out. In addition to the dashboard, I was responsible for creating the final presentation. I designed the slide deck and prepared all but one of the slides, making sure the narrative flowed logically from the business problem to the technical solution and final insights.

On an individual level, I completed my own DIVE analysis, maintained a detailed prompt log documenting how AI-assisted queries evolved over time, and uploaded all of my work to the shared team repository. Through this project, I gained a much deeper appreciation for how complex real-world data analysis becomes once multiple data sources are involved. Integrating hotel booking data with external weather data required careful attention to date alignment, data types, and join logic, since even small mismatches could have significantly distorted results. I learned that feature engineering is often more impactful than raw data alone, as continuous variables like temperature, wind speed, and lead time only became interpretable after thoughtful binning. At the same time, creating these bins introduced new challenges, such as ensuring correct numeric ordering so that visualizations reflected real-world progression rather than alphabetical sorting.

The project also highlighted how visualization tools can sometimes mask underlying data issues, which reinforced the importance of validation steps such as row counts, null checks, and sanity checks before drawing conclusions. Debugging Looker Studio charts taught me that many apparent “data problems” are actually caused by configuration choices rather than errors in the data itself. Finally, I gained an appreciation for data access and governance, as sharing dashboards required explicit credential management to ensure that all team members could view the results. Overall, this project emphasized that meaningful insights come from careful data preparation, validation, and iteration—not just from writing queries or building dashboards.
